1. Dataset Exploration:
    * Download the Iris dataset.
    * Use Python libraries like pandas and NumPy to load and explore the dataset.
    * Perform basic data cleaning and preprocessing tasks (e.g., handling missing values, converting data types).
    * Generate basic descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for the dataset.

2. Data Visualization:
    * Create visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, box plots) using libraries like matplotlib or seaborn to understand the data distribution and relationships between variables.

3. Data Analysis (Optional):
    * If applicable, perform a simple exploratory data analysis (EDA).
    * This could include identifying potential correlations between variables, identifying outliers, or making initial observations about the data.
